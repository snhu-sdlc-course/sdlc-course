{% hint style="info" %}
I suggest creating them by recording your actions in the browser. **Don't forget to add checks** on fields, text, etc., by right-clicking on those elements.
{% endhint %}

Choose **four user stories** to test:

* [ ] **Two** of the _**already implemented user stories** from here:_ [SNHU Library User Stories](../week-3/snhu-library-user-stories/)
* [ ] The **two** user stories **you implemented**

Ensure the following:

* Test cases are named appropriately -- they should reflect the user story they are validation
* All acceptance criteria are validated -- the test case should cover all the acceptance criteria for their corresponding user story
* Test cases are _idempotent_ -- they can be run repeatedly without having to reset the system, reload data, etc.

### **4. Submit Your Work**

* ZIP up your Katalon Studio project folder
* Export the reports for your test cases showing that each of them passed
* Attach the ZIP file and the reports to your submission in Brightspace
