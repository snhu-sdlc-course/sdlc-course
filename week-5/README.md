# Week 5

## Objectives and Purpose

This week will compare traditional _linear-sequential testing practices_ with _agile testing practices_. Agile testing practices are performed _concurrently_ with agile development. This is possible because both the developers and testers are working to, respectively, implement and validate the same acceptance criteria. This practice is known as _Acceptane-Test-Driven Development_. While developers are busy creating new features and writing their automated unit tests, testers are busy writing integration, functional, and acceptance tests. Developers and testers must work closely together so there is a shared understanding of how user stories will be implemented.

You will also learn about automated testing practices, tools, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Incorporating automated testing into your individual development process has the benefit of causing your project to "fail fast" when problems are introduced. Similarly, a continuous integration pipeline allows the team to fail fast if a problem is introduced into the system.

Most importantly, tests should be written with each sprint's _Definition of Done_ in mind. The team should identify the most valuable aspects of each feature comprising the DoD and test those. It is impossible to test 100% of everything. Thus, the team must maintain a _lean_ mindset by prioritizing its efforts.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Prioritize testing activities based on the _Definition of Done_ and user stories
* Create acceptance test cases based on user stories
* Translate test cases into automated functional tests using Katalon Studio
