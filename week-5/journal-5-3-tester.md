# Journal 5-3: Tester

## Overview

The final project for this class includes an APA-format essay serving as a Sprint Review and Retrospective of the SNHU Library project. It also includes a PowerPoint with the aim of convincing corporate executives to adopt the Scrum Agile methodology.

In preparation for these tasks, you will write a series of journals (one per week) that ask you to reflect on the various roles on a Scrum team.

## Prompt

In this journal, you will reflect on your role as a Scrum Software Developer on the SNHU Library project. Spend some time thinking back on the work you did. That work included:

* Installing and configuring Katalon Studio
* Analyzing acceptance criteria and planning test cases that validate them
* Recording automated test cases in Katalon Studio
* Adding validation steps to your automated test cases
* Exporting test case reports that prove the system passed the test cases

At a minimum, address the following topics:

* How did you decide which activities to include in your test cases and which to omit? Put another way, it is impossible to test _everything_. How do you prioritize your efforts?
* How did you choose strategies for validating acceptance criteria? (i.e., how did you choose among the different kinds of validation steps available in Katalon?)
* Do you consider Katalon to be an Agile tool? What are some ways it is and/or is not?
* Do you foresee any problems with using tools like Katalon on a project? If so, explain.
