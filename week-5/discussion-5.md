## Read a Forbes Article About Test Automation

Traditional test automation tools require developers to write test scripts in a programming language. Those scripts are then run automated by a test engine that rolls up their results in a report. Low-code/No-code tools allow people to record themselves performing the test scenario (rather than scripting them in a coding language) while adding validations at various points in the process.

Read this article by Rob Mason (2021) describing the advent of codeless test automation tools and how they can be combined with traditional tools for maximum effect: [The Next Wave of Low-Code/No-Code: Codeless Test Automation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/06/02/the-next-wave-of-low-codeno-code-codeless-test-automation/?sh=ac316b048675).

## Read a Medium Article About Agile Business

This article is really just a list of the _12 Principles of the Agile Business Manifesto_. Read over these quickly, as you will reference them in your response: [12 Principles of the Agile Business Manifesto](https://medium.com/frontira/12-principles-of-the-agile-business-manifesto-58179382852a).

## Your Post

Answer these questions:

1. Teams that have reached higher levels of test automation cited three main challenges they face.
   * List their three main challenges.
   * For each of the three challenges, choose one of the 12 principles of the Agile Business Manifesto and explain how you think it could help solve the problem.
2. Compare and contrast traditional test automation with codeless test automation. Who is required to create traditional automated tests? What about codeless tests? Do you think the article is correct about this? Explain.
3. When do you think teams should choose traditional automated testing over codeless testing?

## Responses to Classmates

Respond to at least 2 classmates. Carefully read their posts. In your response, address things like the following:

* Do you think their chosen principles from the 12 principles of the Agile Business Manifesto will help solve the three main challenges faced by teams with high levels of test automation?
* Do you agree with their thoughts on who is required to perform traditional test automation versus codeless? Explain why you agree/disagree with their position. Compare their position to your position.
* Do their thoughts on when traditional automated testing should be used instead of codeless testing make sense? State your position on this and defend it.
