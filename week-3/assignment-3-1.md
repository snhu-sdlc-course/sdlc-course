# Assignment 3-1

## Assignment Details

In the last assignment, you watched a short animation of your team's first meeting with the client, Connie. She came to your organization in need of a library management solution that can be used to organize her electronics engineering firm's books and documents. **You discovered that SNHU Software has an in-house application for managing its library and that, with a few modifications, it can meet Connie's needs.**

Now, you will watch another animation to learn what modifications are needed to deliver value to Connie.&#x20;

This assignment includes **two tasks**:

1. Using GitHub Projects, create a _Product Backlog_ (with the _Table_ layout) and populate it with five User Stories that capture those modifications. Each User Story must contain the following:
   * Descriptive title
   * Priority based on Connie's feedback
   * Description that contains
     * A short explanation of the work to be done
     * Any clarifying details provided by Connie
     * Testable _acceptance criteria_ that provide a "Definition of Done"
2. Prioritize the User Stories based on the client's input.

When you are done, your Product Backlog should look similar to this:

Each user story should look similar to the one below. Note that your _Acceptance Criteria_ should only be checked by testers once verified.

## Video

Watch this video to discover the client's requirements that will become your user stories.

You can also reference the wireframes shown in the animation:

Finally, you may need to use the **SNHU Electronics** company logo at some point:

## Using GitHub Projects

Last week, you forked the GitHub repository and cloned it to your local machine. You now have a copy of the SNHU Library project. You will create five user stories for this assignment in your GitHub Project. Collectively, your user stories constitute your project's Product Backlog.
