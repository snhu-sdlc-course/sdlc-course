# Journal 2: Product Owner

## Overview

The final project for this class includes an APA-format essay serving as a Sprint Review and Retrospective of the SNHU Library project. It also includes a PowerPoint with the aim of convincing corporate executives to adopt the Scrum Agile methodology.

In preparation for these tasks, you will write a series of journals (one per week) that ask you to reflect on the various roles on a Scrum team.

## Prompt

In this journal assignment, you will reflect on the role you played as the Product Owner of the SNHU Library project. Take the time to analyze the two major tasks you performed for Assignment 3: _identifying requirements based on the animated video_ AND _constructing a product backlog._

At a minimum, address the following topics:

* What details do you need to discover for each requirement the customer mentions?
* What is the most important follow-up question you should ask after the customer identifies a new requirement? Why is it the most important?
* Can you tell the customer you cannot or will not add a feature? What other options do you have when a requested feature is infeasible to add to the backlog?
* How do you write a good user story that provides value to your team?
* What are the most important elements of a user story? What are the most important qualities?
