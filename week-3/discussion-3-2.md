# Discussion 3

## Some Context

Product Owners gather requirements from many different stakeholders. These might include:

* Customers
* Regulators
* Sponsors
* Executives

Normally, customers provide requirements that add value (e.g., features) while the other stakeholders provide requirements that act as constraints (e.g., laws and regulations).&#x20;

A Product Owner guiding the development of a product for a single client knows exactly who their customer is. Examples of this might include a contractor building a product for a government agency, an IT department building a tool for an internal organization, or a small web development firm building an e-commerce site for a boutique.&#x20;

This relationship becomes a bit murkier when the Product Owner works for a company building a product or service to be sold to the masses (e.g., imagine Spotify, Microsoft Office, or Adobe Photoshop). Who is the customer in this relationship? Obviously, the millions of end users are customers, but Product Owners don't have time to consult them all.

## Your Post

Place yourself in the position of a Product Owner working on a team developing a new streaming video feature for a major social media platform (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook).

Answer these three questions:

1. Identify your customer.
   * Who is your customer? Phrased another way, to whom do you address questions when discovering what new features will add value for the end users?&#x20;
   * Your answer may include more than one person.
2. Who judges your success?
   * Who do you invite to the Sprint Review for a demonstration of new features?&#x20;
   * After deployment, how do you gauge the success of the new features?
3. Who has a vested interest in your project?
   * Who are the stakeholders in this scenario?&#x20;
   * Of the stakeholders you identified, which one is the most important?

## Responses to Classmates

Respond to at least 2 classmates. Carefully read their posts. In your response, address things like the following:

* Did they correctly identify the _customer_? Is their answer practicable (can the person(s) identified really be used as a source of requirements)?
* Did they identify a true judge of the project's success? Does the person(s) they identified have the necessary insight to judge the delivered value of new features?
* Is the method of determining success after deployment realistic and effective?
* Are all the stakeholders listed? Are any of the stakeholders listed not true stakeholders?
* Did your peer identify the primary (most important) stakeholder? Is there _one_ most important stakeholder or are there many?
