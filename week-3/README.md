# Week 3

## Objectives and Purpose

This week you will study the _Product Owner_ role of a Scrum team. You will learn what the Product Owner does, what traits make for a good Product Owner, and what tools they often use. You will also be leveraging some of those tools in Assignment 3.

As a future member of a software development team, you will find yourself working with (and potentially filling the role of) a Product Owner. You will also be the recipient and implementor of the Product Owner's outputs: user stories. Finally, you will need to understand how user stories are prioritized into a Product Backlog by a Product Owner.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this week, you will be able to:

* Discover user stories from client input
* Capture user stories in modern, agile requirements management system as a Product Backlog
* Organize a Product Backlog based on client input
* Explain the responsibilities and skills of the Product Owner in a Scrum team
