# #4 Books are Filterable by Title and Author

## User Story

> AS A user
>
> I WANT TO filter the list of books by title and author
>
> SO THAT I can efficiently find the books I want to manage.

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Given I am an authorized user, when I open the app and navigate to the main screen, then I am presented with a filter control above the table of books.
* [ ] Given I am on the main screen, when I key a value into the filter control, then the table of books automatically updates only to show those books whose title or author(s) at least partially match the value I keyed.
* [ ] Given I have keyed a value into the filter control, when the table updates to show the matches, the system ignores the case of both my filter value and of the book titles and authors.
