# #6 Books are Sortable

## User Story

> AS A user
>
> I WANT TO sort the books by the visible columns
>
> SO THAT I can efficiently find the books I want to manage.

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Given I am on the main screen, when I click on any of the visible column headers, then the table of book results is sorted on that single column.
* [ ] Given I am on the main screen, when I click on a visible column header while the column is sorted in \<sort> order, then the column will be re-sorted in \<new sort> order.

| sort       | new sort   |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| unsorted   | ascending  |
| ascending  | descending |
| descending | unsorted   |

* Given I am on the main screen, when the books table is sorted by a visible column, then the sort direction of that column is indicated by an arrow in that column's header.
