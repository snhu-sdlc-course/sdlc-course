# Assignment 3

## Assignment Details

In the last assignment, you watched a short animation of your team's first meeting with the client, Connie. She came to your organization, in need of a library management solution that can be used to organize her electronics engineering firm's books and documents. **You discovered that SNHU Software actually has an in-house application for managing its own library and that, with a few modifications, it can meet Connie's needs.**

Now,  you are going to watch another animation in which you will learn what modifications are needed to deliver value to Connie.&#x20;

This assignment includes **two tasks**:

1. Create a _Product Backlog_ in GitHub and populate it with User Stories that capture those modifications. Each User Story must contain the following:
   * Descriptive title
   * Priority based on Connie's feedback
   * Description that contains
     * A short explanation of the work to be done
     * Any clarifying details provided by Connie
     * Testable _acceptance criteria_ that provide a "Definition of Done"
2. Prioritize the User Stories based on the client's input.

You can also reference the wireframes shown in the animation:

Finally, you may need to use the **SNHU Electronics** company logo, at some point:

## Using GitHub Projects

Last week, you cloned your group's GitHub repository, which contains a copy of the SNHU Library project. For this assignment, each team member will create a user story in your GitHub Project. Collectively, your user stories constitute your project's Product Backlog.
