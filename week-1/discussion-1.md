# Discussion 1

## Your Post

First, tell the class a little about yourself -- introduce yourself and, if you are comfortable with it, share some personal things like your hobbies, interests, favorite books, etc. Be sure to tell the class what career you hope to pursue after completing your degree.

_Waterfall_ is a term used in lieu of a more technical term for that form of lifecycle model, _Linear Sequential Model_. _Waterfall_ has gained a negative connotation over the years, especially with the advent of the Agile movement. Some people feel this negative connotation is unwarranted or outright wrong. They tend to view the dichotomy of Linear Sequential methodologies versus Agile methodologies as a continuum rather than mutually exclusive choices.

Explain why you think it is sometimes appropriate to choose Waterfall or why you think it is never appropriate to choose Waterfall. If you believe Waterfall is the correct choice in certain cases, provide examples. If you believe it should never be used, explain your reasoning.

## Responses to Classmates

Respond to at least 2 classmates. For classmates you agree with, add some supporting evidence they did not mention.&#x20;

For those you disagree with, explain why you think they are wrong and you are right. Provide counterexamples of their position.
