# Discussion 1

## Your Post

### Introduce Yourself

_First, tell the class a little about yourself_ -- introduce yourself and, if you are comfortable with it, share some personal things like your hobbies, interests, favorite books, etc. Be sure to tell the class what career you hope to pursue after completing your degree.

### When is it appropriate to use Waterfall? Explain.

_Waterfall_ is a term used in lieu of a more technical term for that form of lifecycle model, _Linear Sequential Model_. _Waterfall_ has gained a negative connotation over the years, especially with the advent of the Agile movement. Some people feel this negative connotation is unwarranted or outright wrong. They tend to view the dichotomy of Linear Sequential methodologies versus Agile methodologies as a continuum rather than mutually exclusive choices.

_Explain why you think it is sometimes appropriate to choose Waterfall or why you think it is never appropriate to choose Waterfall._ If you believe Waterfall is the correct choice in certain cases, _provide examples_. If you believe it should never be used, _explain your reasoning._

## Responses to Classmates

Respond to at least 2 classmates.&#x20;

* For classmates you _agree_ with, add some supporting evidence they did not mention.&#x20;
* For those you _disagree_ with, explain why you think they are wrong and you are right. Provide counterexamples of their position.
