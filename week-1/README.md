# Week 1

## Objectives and Purpose

Week 1 focuses on the basic stages of software development, how those stages were historically fit into project management methodologies, the shortcomings of the historical methodologies, and how Agile practices remedy these issues.

Anyone working on a software development project should have a solid grasp on how requirements (the problems to be solved) are discovered, transformed into a reliable product, and delivered to a customer. For a team of one, this knowledge might be sufficient. However, as the team size and project complexity grow, these stages of a software project must be structured into a larger project management framework. This framework ideally provides a well-defined process for the flow of information, defines the roles and responsibilities of team members, specifies how project scope is defined and measured, and defines when the project is done.

Week 1 seeks to familiarize you, a future developer and tester, with the basic stages of software development and the various project management frameworks used to organize those phases for teams. When you join a software team you want to know where work comes from, how work is organized and scheduled, how the quality of the work is ensured, and how work is shared amongst multiple people. All of these details are determined by the project management framework.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this week, you will be able to:

1. Describe the core workflows of software development including their activities, inputs, and outputs
2. Compare and contrast traditional software development lifecycle models, define their phases, and explain their shortcomings -- models covered include Waterfall, Spiral, Prototyping, and Incremental
3. Explain what is meant by "Agile" development, describe its origins, and explain how it ameliorates the weaknesses of traditional models
