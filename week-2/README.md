# Week 2

## Objectives and Purpose

This week focuses on gaining a broad understanding of what Scrum is, the roles of Scrum participants, the main artifacts produced during Scrum, and the events that constitute a Scrum iteration. We will also do an in-depth study of the Scrum Master role.

Scrum is the leading SDLC framework in use within the United States with 82% of respondents to agile.ai's _15th Annual State of Agile Report_ (2021) stating that they use either Scrum (66%), ScrumBan (9%), or Scrum/XP Hybrid (6%). The takeaway from this statistic is that you are _extremely_ likely to encounter Scrum in your professional career. In addition, your future employer likely expects you to know how to participate in their SDLC framework on day one. This means that having a basic knowledge of an Agile framework is essential and it only makes sense to focus on the near-universally adopted flavor of Agile, Scrum.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this week, you will be able to:

1. Explain the importance and value of each major Scrum Event (Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, Backlog Grooming, and Daily Standup)
2. Broadly define each Scrum Role: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer, and Tester
3. Discuss the meaning of the four Scrum Values: Commitment and Focus; Openness; Respect; and Courage
4. Describe, in detail, what a Scrum Master does
5. Draw meaningful connections between the Scrum Roles, Scrum Events, and Scrum Values and the increase in Software Quality, reduction in risk, and on-time delivery.
