## Your Post

1. Explain the goals of this meeting and how it was effective in achieving them. Be sure to talk about:
   * How conducive was the format to the goals?
   * What was each member discussing? Why is it necessary for them to present their remarks in front of the team?
   * What role did the Scrum Master play in this process?
   * At the meeting's conclusion, what did each individual team member take away from the meeting?
2. Discuss how the meeting needs to be improved. Some ideas include:
   * Was the team's behavior appropriate? Some well-intentioned playfulness might be okay as long as it doesn't go too far, so feel free to share your honest opinion.
   * Punctuality. How big of an issue is being on time? What's the impact of someone arriving late?
   * How effective was the Scrum Master at keeping things moving along? What strategies did he employ? Were they effective? What else could he try?
   * What prompts/visuals might have been beneficial at this meeting?

## Responses to Classmates

Respond to at least 2 classmates. Carefully read their posts. In your response, address things like the following:

* What ideas do they discuss that you do not?
* What things do you note that they do not?
* Do they give more importance to some of the issues with the meeting than you think necessary?
* Do they suggest strategies the Scrum Master should have tried to make the meeting better? Do you think those strategies would work? Explain.
* What do they believe the members get out of this meeting? Do you agree?
* Do you agree with them on the role the Scrum Master plays or should play?
