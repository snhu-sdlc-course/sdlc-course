# Assignment 2

## What is a Team Charter?

Bruce Tuckman (1965) proposed that every team goes through four stages as it coalesces from a group of individuals into a cohesive team. Those stages are _forming, storming, norming,_ and _performing_. As the team progresses through these phases, they develop a culture and a set of expectations that define them as a team. These four phases result in the team establishing components of its culture. Two of the most important components are:

* Identifying what interpersonal behaviors are acceptable to the group
* Members adopt and play roles that will enhance the team's effectiveness on the project

A common way to help speed up this process is the creation of a _Team Charter_ at the outset of the project. The _Team Charter_ is a document created collaboratively by the team that explicitly states some of the components of its culture. This helps avoid or shorten the _storming_ and _norming_ phases.

For this assignment, watch the animated video below that depicts the initial meeting between the client (SNHU Electronics), scrum master, and product owner. Then use one of the three _Team Charter_ templates listed to create a charter for the SNHU Electronics project discussed in the video.

As a part of this, you must name your software development company.

A team charter is a document that captures a team's shared understanding about:

* The **vision** and **goal** of the project:
  * The **vision** is the value the project intends to deliver its customers (e.g., streamline the onboarding of new employees)
  * The **goal** is how the team plans to create that value (e.g., build a web platform to automate the on-boarding of new employees, maintain employee data throughout their employment, and allow self-administration of employee-selected options)
* **Success criteria** are metrics the team can use to determine if it is succeeding at its vision
  * These should be SMART metrics: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-based
  * Examples might be reducing the time between hiring and onboarding completion from 4 weeks to six business days, reducing data entry errors from 3 per employee to 1 per 10 employees, and reducing the number of calls to the HR department by 50%
* **Key Stakeholders** are the individuals that have a vested interest in the success of the project
  * Key stakeholders include users, decision-makers, financiers or those responsible for funding, middle management responsible for overseeing the project, and executive sponsors who must provide resources
  * Continuing the HR system example, other, less obvious, stakeholders might include owners of systems your product must interface with, downstream individuals impacted by your project (e.g., the employees whose data will be in the system, payroll who relies on W2 data for deducting taxes, managers who need access to contact information), and external organizations like the IRS or 401k fund managers
* **Definition of Done** is the criteria a unit of work (normally a new feature or bug fix) must meet and the related tasks that must be accomplished before it's considered done. Examples include:
  * Static code scans have no findings
  * Overall system unit testing coverage is at least 85%
  * A fellow developer has peer reviewed and approved the code
  * Functional testers certify the changes satisfy all requirements in the User Story
  * User Interface changes meet 508 accessibility standards
* **Roles and Responsibilities** specify each role on the team, who fills it, and what their expected duties and responsibilities are.
* **Core Values** outline what the team believes in. This may seem like a superfluous section that adds little value, but it is essential. The team should spend some time and serious thought on defining a succinct list of values that everyone agrees to uphold. Shared values are what bind a society together, and the team charter is the first step in creating an Agile Team's small society. Examples include;
  * Custom-focused
  * Honesty
  * Freedom to share ideas (even crazy ones)
  * Respect
  * Trust - if you say you'll do something, then do it
  * Integrity - do the right thing even when no one is looking
  * Having fun
* **Norms and Rules** define how the team gets work done. Examples include:
  * Expectations for team members (e.g., punctuality, bringing issues to light early, seeking help before spending too much time on problems)
  * Regularly scheduled meetings (e.g., Daily Stand-up is held every morning at 9:30 EST, Sprint Reviews are always held Friday mornings and Sprint Retrospectives Friday afternoons)
  * Employees will receive quarterly evaluations during the last week of March, June, September, and December
  * How are team decisions made?
* **Communication** specifies the standard methods of communication (e.g., use Slack for direct messages and video, use corporate e-mail, Confluence serves as the knowledge base) and related practices (e.g., the team scribe will post meeting notes to Confluence no later than 2 hours following each meeting and send out the link via e-mail)

One of the most challenging aspects of any project is the team's progression through Tuckman's four stages of _forming, storming, norming, and performing._ A large factor in moving from _storming_ into _norming_ is the development of the team's culture -- its rituals values, morals, goals, and roles.

A _Team Charter_ that is created collaboratively by the team and that explicitly states those components of culture helps speed up the team's transition from _storming_ to _norming_.

## Assignment Details

For this assignment, watch the animated video below that depicts the initial meeting between the client (Connie who represents _SNHU Electronics_), the scrum master (Ron), and the product owner (Amanda). Then, use one of the templates below to create a Team Charter.

You are welcome to create your own name for the software development team/company.
