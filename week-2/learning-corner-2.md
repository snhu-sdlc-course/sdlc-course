## Scrum

> Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. (Schwaber, K., & Sutherland, J., p. 3)

_Scrum_ is an Agile SDLC that is empirical, emphasizing real-time adaptations based on experimentation, and lean, eliminating non-value-added work. It is non-prescriptive, meaning it does not specify how a team should react to every situation; instead, it paints a broad outline of how to do business in a way that deftly handles the unexpected. Scrum works best with small, "_two-pizza_" _teams_ (teams that can be fed with only two pizzas).

Study _Figure 1_ below to get a quick overview of the main characteristics of Scrum.

![Fig. 1: Tenants of Scrum](../.gitbook/assets/tenants\_of\_scrum.png)

The _Scrum Master_ is responsible for ensuring that the project fosters Scrum values creating an environment where:

* The _Product Owner_ prioritizes work for the project and organizes it into a _Product Backlog._
* The _Developers_ and _Testers_ create an increment of value during a    _Sprint._
* The _Scrum Team_ and stakeholders ensure the quality and acceptability of the _Sprint's_ results.

This process is repeated until the project is complete.

## Scrum Values

Scrum depends on the Scrum team striving toward five values:

* Commitment
* Focus
* Openness
* Respect
* Courage

Schwaber and Sutherland explain the importance of these values:

> The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing, to work on tough problems. (p. 4)

## Scrum Roles

Vid. 1: Scrum Roles
{% endembed %}

### Developers

Developers create, maintain, and correct. Their primary purpose for each Sprint is to create a usable output by the end of each Sprint.

They are also responsible for:

* Selecting enough work to occupy them each Sprint and organizing that into a _Sprint Backlog_
* Ensuring their work satisfies the team's _Definition of Done_ before calling a task "done."
* Providing quality code reviews for their peers

### Testers

{% hint style="info" %}
Testers are lumped into the Development Team by the Scrum Methodology. Any role that is "committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint" is considered a Developer (Schwaber & Sutherland, 2020).
{% endhint %}

While not a role technically spelled out in Schwaber's and Sutherland's _Scrum Guide_, a Scrum team must have testers. Often, the Scrum team members will act as both developers and testers.

Testers ensure the product built by developers fulfills the User Stories, meet any functional and non-functional requirements, meet the intent, adheres to regulatory requirements, and, ultimately, satisfies the client.&#x20;

Today, testers usually must be skilled in software development, as well. Often, their test automation tools require the ability to code, understand technical aspects of the software's deployment environment (e.g., web pages' Document Object Model), construct load tests for software interfaces, test RESTful APIs using SOAP and JSON, and perform other highly technical tasks.&#x20;

Testers act as the final quality gate before the client is asked to perform acceptance testing.

### Product Owner

Product Owners act as the client's agent, advocating on their behalf to maximize the product's value to the client.&#x20;

Schwaber and Sutherland provide a great list of the Product Owner's responsibilities:

* Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
* Creating and communicating Product Backlog items;
* Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible, and understood (p. 5).

**Note!** The Product Owner has the _authority_ of the client. The Scrum Team must respect their decisions as if they came directly from the client. Anyone wanting to reprioritize the Product Backlog or change requirements must have all those changes approved by the Product Owner.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is the _servant leader_ of the team. The Scrum Master _is not_ a project manager or a boss.

Their duties include:

* &#x20;Establishing Scrum as the way of doing business;
* Teaching and coaching the team in practicing Scrum;
* Monitoring and maximizing the team's effectiveness and productivity;
* Managing conflict to maintain healthy team dynamics;
* Planning and running team-building activities;
* Ensuring efficient and effective communication channels within the Scrum Team;
* Removing roadblocks and impediments;
* Procuring tools, hardware, software, and any other needed resources;
* Representing the Scrum Team to the rest of the organization; and,
* Scheduling and overseeing Scrum Events.

The Scrum Master has a special relationship with the Product Owner in that they help the Product Owner with their duties by:

* &#x20;  Defining and polishing the Product Goal;
* Assisting with Backlog Grooming (aka - Backing Refinement);
* Performing data analysis to create metrics that drive the empirical planning necessary for Scrum; and,
* Lending any technical expertise to help the Product Owner understand the activities of the Developers and Testers.

## Scrum Events

![Fig. 2: Scrum Events](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png>)

### The Sprint

_Sprints_ are fixed-length periods where the Scrum Team adds value to the product. This process usually takes the form of building new features or resolving bugs. _Sprints are generally 2 to 4 weeks in length._

Rather than setting the length of the Sprint to fit a set of work, the Scrum Team choose just enough work to fill each Sprint. Velocity is the amount of work a team can accomplish in a single sprint.

### **Sprint Planning**

_Sprint Planning_ is a meeting where the Product Owner and the Scrum Team agree on what User Stories to include in the next Sprint.

The Product Owner must prioritize all the User Stories in the Product Backlog. Typically, the Product Owner does this before the Sprint Planning meeting. Then, the Scrum Team estimates the effort required to complete several top stories in the Product Backlog. Based on these estimates, the team selects enough User Stories to occupy them throughout the next Sprint. This is similar to Blackjack in that they want to get the total effort of these stories as close to the team's _Velocity_ as possible without exceeding it.

Finally, the Scrum Team digs into the more technical details required to implement the selected User Stories and begins assigning them to individual members. Sprint Planning is usually limited to four hours.

### Daily Standup

The _Daily Standup_ is time set aside every day for the team to sync up. It allows the team members to coordinate their efforts, get situational awareness of the team's goings-on, and point out any obstacles or impediments of which they are aware.

Typically, each member takes a turn speaking and answers some variation of these three questions:

1. What did you accomplish yesterday?
2. What do you plan to accomplish today?
3. What obstacles are in your way?

The Scrum Master leads this meeting. Typically, the Scrum Master or an assigned scribe will update the team's task tracking tool as each person speaks.

In face-to-face arrangements, the team traditionally stands in a circle for this meeting. In today's remote arrangements, the team ideally uses webcams to personalize the session. These meetings should not exceed fifteen minutes, and the team should strive to beat that time, if possible.

### Sprint Review

The _Sprint Review_ is essentially a chance for the team to show off their work to the Product Owner and, maybe, the client or other stakeholders. The team should record any feedback given by the stakeholders. This feedback will guide future priorities and work.

This meeting should not exceed four hours.

### Sprint Retrospective

The _Sprint Retrospective_ is the Scrum Team's foremost opportunity to perform process improvement. During this meeting, the team looks critically at how efficiently and effectively they have performed, how closely they have followed the Scrum guidelines, how well they communicated, and other dynamics that impact their operations. The Sprint Retrospective is similar to what is often called a _postmortem_.&#x20;

While critiquing their performance during the past Sprint, the team makes suggestions for ways to improve their operations and, importantly, recognizes their successes. It is vital that this meeting not be viewed as a condemnation but as an opportunity for improvement and celebration of achievements.

**Note!** It is _essential_ that this meeting remains focused on the process and not the people. Personal attacks will not only ruin this opportunity but will cause fissures in the team. Good Scrum Masters will often begin this meeting with fun, team-building activities to lighten the mood and "destress" the team before assessing their performance.

The Sprint Retrospective should generate a list of task assignments and process changes that seek to prevent or correct negative findings. _Remember_, if there is not exactly one person responsible for implementing each improvement by a due date, the improvements will never happen.

### Backlog Grooming

During Backlog Grooming, the Product Owner and, often, the Scrum Master review all the stories in the Product Backlog to ensure they:

* Are still valid requirements;
* Have enough detail for the team accurately estimate their effort;
* Are correctly prioritized;
* Have been updated with the latest information and progress;
* Have not already been completed; and,
* Do not depend on some other task(s) being completed first.

In short, Backlog Grooming is a meeting that usually takes place once or twice per Sprint to ensure all the User Stories in the Sprint are ready for the Sprint Planning meeting.

## Scrum Artifacts

Vid. 2: Scrum Events and Artifacts
{% endembed %}

Scrum has relatively few artifacts thanks to its emphasis on _lean_ practices -- if something does not add value, it gets cut. A commitment accompanies each of the Scrum artifacts. That commitment reinforces Scrum's empiricism (Schwaber and Sutherland, p. 10):

| Artifact        | Commitment         |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Product Backlog | Product Goal       |
| Sprint Backlog  | Sprint Goal        |
| Increment       | Definition of Done |

### Product Backlog

![Fig. 3: The Flow of Requirements from Stakeholders to the Product Owner, from the Product Owner to the Product Backlog, and from the Product Backlog into Sprint Backlogs](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Copeland defines the _Product Backlog_ as "essentially a queue of work to be done" (p. 68). The word _queue_ implies an ordering of the items (user stories, in this case). Depending on the amount and detail of planning required (e.g., determining cost, duration, and resource requirements), the Product Backlog may cover only the next few sprints, or it may include enough work to occupy the team for the foreseeable future.&#x20;

The _Product Goal_ is a commitment that guides and is embodied by the Product Backlog. The Product Goal describes the value the Scrum Team hopes to deliver by creating the product.

### Sprint Backlog

As shown in Figure 3 (above), the Sprint Backlog is a subset of user stories selected from the top of the Product Backlog that represents enough effort to keep the Scrum Team occupied for a single sprint. However, the Scrum Team should be able to complete all the items in the Sprint Backlog by the end of the Sprint.

The _Sprint Goal_ is a commitment that guides and is embodied by the Sprint Backlog. The Sprint Goal is the "single objective for the Sprint" (Schwaber and Sutherland, p. 11). It focuses the team's efforts because they know, above all else, they must deliver the value described by the Sprint Goal by the end of the Sprint. This statement is defined during the Sprint Planning meeting.

### Increment

An _increment_ is a unit of value created by the completion of work during a Sprint. As the project moves along, increments add up toward the total product. These increments are the work products presented to stakeholders during Sprint Review meetings. Above all, increments must be usable at the end of each Sprint. The team only considers an increment usable if it meets the _Definition of Done_ created by the Scrum Team.

The _Definition of Done_ is "a formal description of the state of the increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product" (Schwaber and Sutherland, p. 12).

The Definition of Done often includes criteria like:

* Satisfies all acceptance criteria defined in the user story;
* Has no failing unit tests;
* Has at least 85% code coverage;
* Passes static code scanning quality gates, including code smells, code duplication, security hotspots, complexity, and reliability;
* Has been reviewed and approved by another developer; and,
* Has been merged into the `master` branch.
