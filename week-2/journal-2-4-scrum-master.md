# Journal 1: Scrum Master

## Overview

The final project for this class includes an APA-format essay serving as a Sprint Review and Retrospective of the SNHU Library project. It also includes a PowerPoint with the aim of convincing corporate executives to adopt the Scrum Agile methodology.

In preparation for these tasks, you will write a series of journals (one per week) that ask you to reflect on the various roles on a Scrum team.

## Prompt

In this first journal, you will consider the role of the Scrum Master and the tasks you performed while acting in that role. You will also take your understanding of the Scrum Master's responsibilities and suggest how those duties might be carried out through the remainder of the SNHU Library project.

At a minimum, address the following topics:

* Describe the purpose of each Scrum event (e.g., Backlog Grooming, Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-up, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective) and why they are important -- consider how each event contributes to the success of a project
* Explain how you, as the Scrum Master, would successfully plan and execute it
* How would you determine if each event achieved its intended goal? Imagine how you might measure the success of each event?
* How does the Scrum Master role differ from that of a Project Manager?
* What personal traits help make a Scrum Master effective? Support your ideas by citing responsibilities Scrum Masters must perform and situations they are likely to find themselves in.
