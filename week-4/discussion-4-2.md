## Read a Little About Swarming

If you haven't done so already, read the section on _Swarming_ at the bottom of [learning-corner-4.md](learning-corner-4.md "mention").&#x20;

Now, read this article on [Agile Swarming](https://www.teamly.com/blog/agile-swarming/).

## Your Post

Imagine you are on an Agile Scrum team as a Software Developer.&#x20;

Answer these 3 questions:

1. Describe a situation where
   * Scheduled swarming might be applied
   * Unscheduled swarming might be applied
2. It is obvious that swarming has a high cost in terms of time and resources because more than one team member is being allocated to a single problem. In your opinion:
   * Is the additional cost justified?
   * Are there times when swarming is not justified? If so, provide examples.
3. What is the difference, if any, between _swarming_ and _pair programming_?

## Responses to Classmates

Respond to at least 2 classmates. Carefully read their posts. In your response, address things like the following:

* Do the situations they mention in _question 1_ justify the resources swarming requires?&#x20;
* Do you see any differences between the example provided for _scheduled_ swarming and the one for _unscheduled_ swarming?
* Do they provide quality and compelling arguments for _justifying_ or _not justifying_ the use of swarming?
* Do you agree with their explanation about the differences (or lack of differences) between _swarming_ and _pair programming_? If you disagree, be sure to explain why and fully justify your position.
