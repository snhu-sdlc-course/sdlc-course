# Journal 3: Developer

## Overview

The final project for this class includes an APA-format essay serving as a Sprint Review and Retrospective of the SNHU Library project. It also includes a PowerPoint with the aim of convincing corporate executives to adopt the Scrum Agile methodology.

In preparation for these tasks, you will write a series of journals (one per week) that ask you to reflect on the various roles on a Scrum team.

## Prompt

In this journal, you will reflect on your role as a Scrum Software Developer on the SNHU Library project. Spend some time thinking back on the work you did. That work included:

* Estimating story points for 5 user stories
* Selecting user stories for the new sprint (you selected one for yourself)
* Implementing code changes
* Updating the ticket status and comments
* Having your changes peer-reviewed by a classmate
* Making changes suggested by your peer reviewer

At a minimum, address the following topics:

* How did you determine the value of a story point for the new project and team?
* How did you decide the number of story points to assign each user story?
* Assuming you were unfamiliar with the SailsJS or Angular frameworks, what resources did you use to gain enough proficiency to complete the task?
* What kinds of information did you think important to include in your ticket comments?
* In what ways was your classmate's peer review helpful? In what ways was it lacking?&#x20;
* What things did you look for when reviewing someone else's code?
