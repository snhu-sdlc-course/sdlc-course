# Week 4

## Objectives and Purpose

Week 4 looks at using agile techniques to estimate effort and at implementing a user story in code. You will learn about estimation methods like story points and T-shirt sizes. Then, you will estimate the size of each item in the backlog you created last week. Finally, you will select an item from the backlog and implement it in code.

As a developer, you will be expected to participate in Sprint Planning sessions where you and your teammates estimate the sizes of user stories based on their details and acceptance criteria. It is imperative that you understand the need for and mechanics of agile estimation. You must also be prepared to select a user story from the Sprint Backlog for yourself.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this week, you will be able to:

* Determine the complexity and size of a user story based on its details, acceptance criteria, and other artifacts
* Use the complexity and size of user stories in a product backlog to estimate the sizes using story points
* Build a Sprint Backlog from a Product Backlog based on team velocity and the estimated sizes of the user stories
* Participate on a Scrum Agile software development team as a developer by selecting a user story, making changes to the application, recording relevant details about your work in a project management system, and updating the status of your user story, as appropriate
