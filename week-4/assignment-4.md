# Assignment 4

## Overview

This assignment comprises two tasks:

1. Perform _Sprint Planning_ for the first sprint of the SNHU Electronics Library Catalog project
2. Implement one user story of the first Sprint

## Sprint Planning

### Instructions

You will perform the _Sprint Planning_ for the first sprint of the project.

This involves two tasks:

* Estimate the effort for each task in _Product Backlog_
* Assign enough user stories to _Sprint 1_ to occupy your team -- this means you will assign **one task** because **the team comprises you,** and **you only have one week**

Here is a short video showing you how to perform _Sprint Planning_ in GitHub projects:
