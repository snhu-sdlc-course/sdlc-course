# Week 6

## Objectives and Purpose

To be effective on non-trivial projects, especially for distributed teams, you must be familiar with modern project management and communication tools. Your textbook refers to Agile project management tools as _information radiators_.&#x20;

While face-to-face communication is always preferable, it is rare to be on a completely co-located team today. Even when people work in the same office, they frequently need to exchange short missives without getting up and interrupting their teammates. Teams today solve these problems with chat and video conferencing tools.

By the end of this week, you will be familiar with the common features of both information radiators and team communications tools. You will also get some practice at using these sorts of tools.
