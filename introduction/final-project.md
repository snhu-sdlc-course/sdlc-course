# Final Project

The final project for this course is a 3-part submission:

1. An **APA-formatted Sprint Review and Retrospective** that demonstrates your understanding of the purposes and interrelationships of Scrum roles, activities, and products. You will do this by critically analyzing your execution of the assignments throughout this course.
2. An **Executive PowerPoint Presentation** that pitches the adoption of Scrum to a non-technical, executive-level audience. This demonstrates your understanding of the Software Development Lifecycle and the benefits of using the Agile Scrum methodology to manage projects.
3. Your **Contributions to a Class Retrospective** that focus on _your participation in_ and _the content of_ this course. This demonstrates your ability to participate in a blame-free, collaborative Scrum Retrospective and gives you an opportunity to help improve this course for future students.

## An APA-formatted Sprint Review and Retrospective

{% hint style="info" %}
You are **required** to use the template below for your essay. It already has headings created for all the mandatory topics you must discuss.
{% endhint %}

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/CS250 Sprint Review and Retrospective.docx" %}

Your essay must, at a minimum, do the following:

* Explain how the various roles on your Scrum-agile Team specifically contributed to the success of the SNHU Library project
* Describe how a Scrum-agile approach to the SDLC helped each of the user stories come to completion
* Describe how the Scrum-agile approach supported project completion when the project was interrupted and changed direction
* Demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively with your team by providing samples of your communication
* Evaluate the organizational tools and Scrum-agile principles that helped your team be successful
* Assess the effectiveness of the Scrum-agile approach for the SNHU Library project
  * Describe the pros and cons that the Scrum-agile approach presented during the project
  * Determine whether or not a Scrum-agile approach was the best approach for the SNHU Library development project

You must cite all references used in your paper. This includes your textbook.
{% endhint %}

## Executive PowerPoint Presentation

A PowerPoint presentation intended for an executive audience whom you intend to convince to adopt the Scrum methodology. You will provide an overview of the Scrum process, compare and contrast it with Linear Sequential processes, and provide a list of criteria they can use to evaluate their options. In your presentation, you must address, at a minimum, the following:

* Explain the various roles on a Scrum-agile Team by identifying each role and describing its importance.
* Explain how the various phases of the SDLC work in an agile approach. Be sure to identify each phase and describe its importance.
* Describe how the process would have been different with a waterfall development approach rather than the agile approach you used. For instance, you might discuss how a particular problem in development would have proceeded differently.
* Explain what factors you would consider when choosing a waterfall approach or an agile approach, using your course experience to back up your explanation.
